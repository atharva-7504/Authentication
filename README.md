# Authentication
A secure authentication system built with Node.js, Express, Passport.js, and PostgreSQL. Users can register with email and password (hashed securely), log in using sessions and cookies, stay authenticated with Passport serialization, use Google OAuth 2.0, and access protected routes via authentication middleware.
